1. Verify whether the job posting is legit

Companies might have published notice like this

Ask the officials of the company to verify the information

Look for red flags like we discussed

2. Avoid giving out your personal information to strangers

- Do not fill out random forms that ask for your personal information or PII
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Read point #1 again
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

3. Understand that legit recruiters do not ask you to:

- comment #interested, or
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- send them connection request so that they can check your profile, or
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- follow them on xyz social media, or
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- contact them on xyz platform, or
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- send them money for anything, or
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- do anything that sounds suspicious, really
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
